Contributing to mycsus wiki
=============================

However, we do hope you follow this guidelines to help keep the wiki consistent. Contents that deviate far from these guidelines may be edited, or deleted.

Contribution guidelines
-------------------------

### Keep contents PG-13
It may be fun to curse while coding, but this wiki is not the place..  :P

### Use Markdown
Markdown looks good in both HTML and plain text, fun for both editing, viewing on github, and downloading for local use. Please don't use HTML in the markdown files (it works, but the text files will look ugly :( )

### Keep contents beginnner friendly
Authors can assume that the reader knows programming. General contents (i.e. Web dev) should assume that the reader knows nothing about the domain. More specific contents (i.e. JQuery) can assume that the reader have the general domain knowledge.

### Structure pages logically
Unfortunately the wiki does not have a way of grouping pages. We will follow the following naming convention: If the topic is general, the page will have the topic's name (i.e. Web developement). If it is specific, the page will have a general name, followed by a dash and the specific topic (i.e. Web developement - JQuery).
